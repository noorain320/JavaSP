1. Write a Java program to create a class called "Person" with a name and age attribute. 
Create two instances of the "Person" class, set their attributes using the constructor, 
and print their name and age.


2. Write a Java program to create a class called "Dog" with a name and breed attribute.
Create two instances of the "Dog" class, set their attributes using the constructor 
and modify the attributes using the setter methods and print the updated values.

3. Write a Java program to create a class called "Rectangle" with width and height 
attributes. Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

4. Write a Java program to create a class called "Employee" with a name, job title,
and salary attributes, and methods to calculate and update salary.


5. Write a Java program to create class called "TrafficLight" with attributes for color
 and duration, and methods to change the color and check for red or green.

6.Create an abstract class called Shape with an abstract method calculateArea(). 
Then, create two subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, that extend the Shape class
 and implement the calculateArea() method to calculate the area of a circle 
 and a rectangle, respectively.

7.Create an interface called Shape with two constant fields: PI and E. Implement this 
interface in a class called Circle and use the constants to calculate
 the circumference and area of a circle.

8.Create a basic banking system with three classes:
 Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount.

Account Class:
Properties: accountNumber, balance
Methods: deposit(double amount), withdraw(double amount), and a constructor to set the account number and initial balance.

SavingsAccount Class (subclass of Account):
Additional Property: interestRate
Method: addInterest(), which adds interest to the account balance based on the interest rate.

CheckingAccount Class (subclass of Account):
Additional Property: overdraftLimit
Method: withdraw(double amount), which allows withdrawing funds up to the overdraft limit.

Write a Main class to demonstrate the use of these classes by creating instances of both SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount.
